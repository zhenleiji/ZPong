# ZPong
Basic example used to learn pygame.

## Game
The game was implemented in a few hours. So do not pay too much attention to details. I didn't implement the HUD. :/

It is based on classical pong game. The only difference is you need to control 4 bars at the same time!

Challenge yourself and prove your skill!
